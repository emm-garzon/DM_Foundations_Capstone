# Family Tracker | Dashboard

A web application built using the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS / Flexbox
- Javascript
- Node.js / Express

Inspired by the Weasely's Family Clock -- a magical item in the 'Harry Potter' mythology -- it did not tell time, but instead showed the relative location of each member of the family. This application allows a user to set their name, role, and location -- all of which display in the main dashboard, easily viewable by any passerby.

Coded over the course of a week as a mid-term capstone for the DevMountain Web Development program; students were challenged to output a complete CRUD that displayed interactivity between the front, and back-end, DOM manipulation, and the ability to work with data from an external source (in this case a JSON file, containing an array of objects).

While I was ultimately responsible for the code written, I had the benefit of counsel from my instructors, the opportunity to workshop ideas with my classmates, and my family tested the application ad nausem -- all of whom I thank for their time, and support, as I continue this journey in learning to code.
